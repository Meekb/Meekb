### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Beth ðŸ˜„ pronouns she/her - a former logistics planner turned software developer with a passion for puzzles and problem solving. I thrive within a collaborative team environment and particularly enjoy the planning process of application architecture. 17-years of logistics experience and transportation industry knowledge have helped me become a more flexible and adaptable team member who can make solid informed decisions. I'm set to graduate from Turing School of Software and Design in October 2021 and am excited to join a creative team within the travel or transportation industries.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a group project utilizing TypeScript in React
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: meeker.bethm@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Traveling for a deeper experience and understanding of the world is my biggest passion. I began to pursue this dream at age 20 and it's led me to stand upon The Great Wall of China, St. Mary's Basilica in Krakow Poland, and riding a two-humped camel through the Gobi desert.
