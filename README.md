### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Beth ðŸ˜„ pronouns she/her - a former logistics planner turned software developer with a passion for puzzles and problem solving. January 2021 I attended Turing School of Software and Design for Front End Development (vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, ES6 JavaScript, React, Mocha/Chai, Cypress). I accepted my first dev job working for Knight-Swift Transportation LLC as a Full Stack I in August. Over the last six months I've learned Vue, Nuxt.js, Storybook for UI components, and interacting/building with a CMS - Directus in this case. Check out my current side-learning journey below. I thrive within a collaborative team environment and particularly enjoy the planning process of application architecture. 17-years of logistics experience and transportation industry knowledge have helped me become a more flexible and adaptable team member who can make solid informed decisions. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m continuing to build a backend toolset
- ðŸŒ± Currently working to complete Codecademy course [Create REST APIs with Spring and Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/create-rest-apis-with-spring-and-java)
- âœ… View my completed [Certificates](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/bethMeeker2365205360): Learn Node.js, Learn PHP, and Connecting Front-End to Back-End
- âš¡ Fun fact: Traveling for a deeper experience and understanding of the world is my biggest passion. I began to pursue this dream at age 20 and it's led me to stand upon The Great Wall of China, St. Mary's Basilica in Krakow Poland, and riding a two-humped camel through the Gobi desert.
