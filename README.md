### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Beth ðŸ˜„ pronouns she/her - a former logistics planner turned software developer with a passion for puzzles and problem solving. I just accepted my first dev job working for Knight-Swift Transportation LLC as a Full Stack I. That means I have a whole hell of a lot of learning to do! I thrive within a collaborative team environment and particularly enjoy the planning process of application architecture. 17-years of logistics experience and transportation industry knowledge have helped me become a more flexible and adaptable team member who can make solid informed decisions. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m continuing to build a backend toolset by learning some Java basics 
- ðŸŒ± Currently working to complete Codecademy course Create REST APIs with Spring and Java
- âœ… Intro PHP - built a basic movies API using PHP & MySQL with XAMPP
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: meeker.bethm@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Traveling for a deeper experience and understanding of the world is my biggest passion. I began to pursue this dream at age 20 and it's led me to stand upon The Great Wall of China, St. Mary's Basilica in Krakow Poland, and riding a two-humped camel through the Gobi desert.
